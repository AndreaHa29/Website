                <p1>
                        I grew up in a small town in rural Wisconsin and I don’t remember my school teaching us a lot
                        about career development. Back in elementary school though, I wanted to be a writer and then in
                        middle school I wanted to be a mathematician because no one else wanted to and I thought “well I
                        can do that”. Then in high school I wanted to go in to international business.
                </p1>

                </h3>
                <p1>
                        I ended up going to college to study engineering because I was always super good at math and my
                        grandma told me that it would be a good field for me. There were also a lot of scholarships that
                        were only available if I studied engineering which was important to me because I had my son when
                        I was sixteen. I wanted to make sure that I could pay for both college and daycare because my
                        parents weren’t supporting me at the time.
                </p1>

                <h3>
                        Can you tell us about ChickTech?

                </h3>
                <p1>
                        ChickTech is a national non-profit organization giving women opportunities to thrive in STEM
                        fields. We are in 27 chapters across the country and Canada with about 1,500 volunteers. We
                        focus on building a tech-pipeline to get amazing girls who aren’t thinking of themselves as
                        technologists to change their minds about who they are and what a technologist “should look
                        like”. We are also piloting a ChickTech college program this year to build a community and
                        connections for college women in STEM majors. The ChickTech team has all these amazing
                        connections so if we can link college women with industry women, these students have a much
                        better chance at finding companies that will treat the right and respect them. Once women are in
                        the industry, we host ACT-W conferences and meetups throughout the year to maintain that network
                        of women who can support each other in STEM.

                <h3>
                        Have you ever been treated differently in your career because you were a woman?

                </h3>
                <p1>
                        When I was in college, I was often discriminated against by other women because I was pregnant
                        as a student. Once I graduated with a degree in computer science, I then worked for a what I
                        very kindly call the “worst company in the world”. There, I experienced blatant sexual
                        harassment– men would touch me and speak to me inappropriately right in front of clients. Even
                        when I told the higher-ups in the company, they ignored me and tried to brush the issue under
                        the rug. I decided that I had to quit even if I didn’t have a backup plan because I was just so
                        emotionally drained from issues at work.

                </p1>
                <br></br>
                <p1>I went back to school to earn my MBA with a focus on sustainability. Afterwards, I started
                        volunteering at an organization to help minorities and girls pursue technology fields and fell
                        in love with what I was doing. All of these experiences combined lead me to create ChickTech, a
                        resource that would make women feel powerful in an industry where I had felt powerless.

                <h3>
                        How have you seen the STEM community evolve in terms of diversity?

                </h3>
                <p1>
                        It’s hard to tell because there is a lot of talk and not much action so there is less change
                        that some might think. What people sometimes forget is that even though gender diversity is an
                        issue in STEM, you can’t just fix one industry; you have to focus on the workforce as a whole. I
                        understand that it’s hard though. On the hierarchy of things that a company can focus on at once
                        – sales, marketing, development – gender diversity just seems less important. Even in the
                        companies who do work towards building an inclusive workplace, a lot of men still have
                        unconscious bias against women. Overall, I still think there is a lot to be done.

                </p1>
                <h3>
                        What advice would you give girls pursuing STEM?
                </h3>
                <p1>
                        I remember back in college, every term, I would buy new clothes, notebooks, etc. and I would
                        struggle to choose between the “girly” stuff and the “masculine” stuff. I would end up picking
                        the more masculine things because I wanted to fit in with the students in my computer
                        engineering classes. In hindsight, I really wish I didn’t do that because worrying about others’
                        opinions just ended up making me unhappy.

                </p1>
                <br></br>

                <p1>
                        What I’m trying to say is that fitting into stereotypes does you and the industry a disservice
                        because we need diversity. When you finally find a community where you no longer feel isolated,
                        bias will be put into perspective and you’ll realize it’s not you, it’s them because you are
                        perfect.
