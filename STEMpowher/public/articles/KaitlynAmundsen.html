                        I remember one time, in elementary school, we had a science lesson in class. The teacher brought
                        out fake caterpillars that would turn into monarch butterflies to model "metamorphosis"—a big
                        word for me in the first grade. To help the caterpillars grow, we made a garden and filled it
                        with mini plants.

                        I really wanted to be a veterinarian when I was a kid because I grew up with my dog, Rufus, and
                        always had a soft spot for animals. I was the person who would cry watching sad movies with dogs
                        in them, especially Marley and Me. Later, I found out that part of the job of a veterinarian was
                        to put pets down. I could never do that for a career, so I thought of becoming a basketball
                        coach instead.

                <h3>
                        Have you ever been treated differently because you were a girl?

                <p1>
                        I don’t think that I was ever treated differently in STEM classes specifically. In my home life,
                        though, I noticed that my brother was always considered the math brainiac, while I was more so
                        the artistic one in the family. Maybe, this was just because we were interested in different
                        things. Although growing up, I often felt like my brother was smarter than me because of these
                        "stereotypes". I now realize that we’re just smart in different ways, but that is something I
                        had to learn overtime.

                <h3>
                        What made you pursue physiology for your major?

                </h3>
                <p1>
                        In my freshman year of high school, I tore my ACL in a basketball game. The doctors told me that
                        I wouldn’t be able to play competitively ever again. Honestly, I was quite devastated and
                        depressed at the news—especially since I had been playing for my entire life and even had plans
                        to play in college. I went to physical therapy sessions for almost a year to recover. Through
                        talking to my therapists, I learned some interesting things about anatomy and how our muscles
                        and bones work together. I even took a Human Biology class at my local community college to
                        further delve into the topic. It took me a long time to get over the fact that I could no longer
                        play competitive basketball but I learned that it wasn’t the end of the world and through my
                        injury, I found a new passion—physiology.
